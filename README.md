# Edge-Detection---Image-Processing
Edge detection methods for finding object boundaries in images Edge detection is an image processing technique for finding the boundaries of objects within images. It works by detecting discontinuities in brightness. Edge detection is used for image segmentation and data extraction in areas such as image processing, computer vision, and machine vision.  Common edge detection algorithms include Sobel, Canny, Prewitt, Roberts, and fuzzy logic methods.
